I have decided to change my overall theme for website. I had previously had an ocean themed website and this theme was really hard to 
execute creatively. It was either looking like an informatic website about ocean creatures or looking like a normal website about water. 
This made it had for to execute a good internet artwork and provide a well-executed internet art website that connected with actual internet 
artwork. I had noticed my use of colours, fonts and interactivity were not giving representing my initial theme. The website looked quite 
generic, and I only used images and videos in a simplistic way and not creatively. Therefore, I decided to change my theme and make it on 
Renaissance artwork. I have had a great interest in The Renaissance and the art that was created around those times. 
   </p> 

      <p>
      Renaissance art had a unique style throughout the paintings, sculptures, etc. Famous Renaissance artists that many would know are
      Leonardo Da Vinci who made the famous Mona Lisa and Michelangelo who sculpted the David. The artwork during this time had a great 
      influence of the Catholic Church and this is seen in pieces such as The Last Supper and Pietà. According to the article of Renaissance 
      art on History, many of artworks that we love and admire today “were seen and used mostly as religious souvenirs”(Editors n.d.)
  </p>

  <p>
  The four characteristics of Renaissance art that I found during my research are the following: “revival of classical Greek or Roman art 
  forms and styles, humanism, the mastery of illusionistic painting techniques (maximizing ‘depth’ in a picture which includes linear 
  perspective, foreshortening and quadrature and lastly naturalistic realism of faces and figures”(“Renaissance Art: History, Characteristics” n.d.). 
  Therefore, for my internet artwork I want to be able to capture a collage of renaissance art pieces. 
</p>

 <p>
 I want to be able to make this art pieces be interactive and have the user ‘build’ or make their own digital renaissance art piece. 
 I am looking to make use of images of two art paintings and an image of one sculpture. I want to take these three art pieces and divide 
 them into squares and have the users build their own hybrid renaissance artwork. I have attached a few images I would use to compile the 
 art piece. The interactivity will make use of the drag and drop method for the building of the artworks.
