I always put more focus on the technical component of all my submissions because it will be pointless having all the blogs and creative ideas done and implemented but the users cannot see it because the website is not functional. In my exam submission, I had tried to split my time towards all components evenly but once again I ran into a lot of technical errors which needed me to focus more on them.

      In the beginning of the development of my exam website, I had run into a Visual Code issue. My VS code had suddenly started being extremely slow which affected my overall progress. I had tried to inform my lecturers to get assistance, but I did not get a reply and I tried googling all possible solutions. I then decided to completely delete VS code an reinstall it and this fixed the delay.

One thing I struggle with assignment after assignment is deployment, I always get different types of errors during the last minutes of due date. Therefore, I decided that I would deploy my website during the development of website. Even though I will be deploying bits and bits of small changes of my website, I will have enough time to solve any deployment errors that I may run into and do it in time So far, this method has worked perfectly, and I have not run into any deployment issues.

      The technical feedback I received for my assignment two was that I need to use more microformatting, more semantic markups and just clean up code. Interactive media last year we were taught that we should not use div because some computers will not read our applications correctly, so we need to make use of semantic markups. I then got confused when we were given our lecturers on React js this year and we were using div so I think I got confused as to when exactly should we use semantic markups and not. However, I was able to remove most of my div tags and use more semantic markups in my website.

  I had noticed that I am really not familiar with a lot of coding terms. Is it possible if I could request that we get more technical classes and technical tutorial classes where we are taught specific things? For example, one week we would like how to improve responsiveness, the next week we learn how to use Reactjs to create cool animation effects/transitions, or even have classes the focus strictly on proving CSS, html, JavaScript, React, all separated? It is really having to rely mostly of YouTube tutorials and Stack Overflow on how to build a website, I am nervous to go into the workspace next year as junior front end developer that isnâ€™t comfortable with coding.
